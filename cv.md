# **About Me**
Currently I have started training at RS-school. My goal for the course is to gain all the knowledge it will give me and learn to use it in practice. I am a very responsible person, ready to spend all my time learning or completing assigned tasks and enjoying this process. My strengths are perseverance, determination, the ability to remain calm in any situation and solve it.
